### Background
The core idea was conceived during the ChainLink 2023 hackathon, but due to our limited experience with web3, we were unable to complete even 10% of the project. 

We are pleased to announce that during Hackout 2023, we were able to develop 80% of what we had originally envisioned, and we plan to update it in the near future.

### Components built during hackathon
1. Entire web3 infrastructure: including smart contract development, deployment and integrating with the client, testing
2. Core logic: Facilitaing posting a project, managing projects and applications. The entire flow was ideated and executed by us.

### Pre-Built Components Used
1. Github Authentication
2. 10% of the frontend (not involving any core logic) was reused
3. Firebase structure
